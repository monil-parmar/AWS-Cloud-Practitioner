# Amazon AWS Cloud Practitioner Project  
### Case Project: Foundational Hands-On Experience with AWS Cloud  

## Overview  
This project is a **practical lab-based study** completed as part of the **AWS Cloud Practitioner training**. It involved interactive activities and real-world AWS console usage to reinforce foundational cloud computing concepts. The labs covered key AWS services such as EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, RDS, and more.

## Objective  
The project aims to build essential AWS skills by exploring cloud services through guided hands-on labs. These labs are aligned with topics from the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** exam, helping to develop a strong understanding of core AWS offerings and operational practices.

## Scenario  
As a cloud practitioner in training, I was tasked with completing a series of structured lab exercises that simulate real-world tasks like launching EC2 instances, configuring IAM policies, estimating cloud costs, managing storage, and deploying web applications in a virtual private cloud.

## Activities Covered  

### **Activity 01: AWS Management Console Clickthrough**  
- Explored AWS Console navigation  
- Identified service categories and global vs. regional services  

### **Activity 02: AWS Cost Estimation Using Pricing Calculator**  
- Estimated monthly cost for EC2, S3, and data transfer  
- Gained insight into pricing structure and budgeting on AWS  

### **Activity 03: Introduction to AWS IAM**  
- Created users and groups

### **Activity 04: Build Your VPC and Launch a Web Server**  
- Created custom VPC and subnets  
- Launched a web server with a security group  

### **Activity 05: Introduction to Amazon EC2**  
- Launched and monitored EC2 instances  
- Resized instances and enabled termination protection  

### **Activity 06: Working with Amazon EBS**  
- Created, attached, and managed EBS volumes

- Deployed and interacted with an RDS MySQL instance  


# AWS Migration Proposal Project  
### Case Project: Migrating On-Premises Infrastructure to AWS Cloud  

## Overview  
This project is a **real-world cloud migration proposal** created as part of an AWS Cloud Practitioner assignment. It outlines the strategic benefits, services, and steps involved in migrating an on-premise e-commerce infrastructure to the AWS Cloud.

## Objective  
The objective was to assess a growing company's IT environment and provide a cost-effective, scalable AWS-based solution to reduce operational overhead while ensuring security, performance, and flexibility.

## Scenario  
As an AWS Cloud Practitioner, I evaluated the infrastructure of *My Healthy Eating Inc.* and proposed a migration plan to transition its on-premise three-tier web application to AWS. The proposal includes estimated monthly costs, recommended AWS services, and a phased migration roadmap.

## Key Topics Covered  
- Benefits of cloud migration vs. on-premise setup  
- Recommended AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, ELB, CloudWatch)  
- High-level cost estimation  
- Step-by-step migration strategy using tools like AWS DMS and DataSync
